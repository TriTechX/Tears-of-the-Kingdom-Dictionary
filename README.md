# TotKED
Tears of the Kingdom Equipment Dictionary: A Python program that acts as a dictionary for all the data for armour, weapons, shields, and bows.

## Installation
You must have Python 3 installed on your computer. It must be running Windows, or unexpected errors may occur.
Download the latest ```.exe``` release for TotKED in releases. Execute the file as normal. Errors will come up saying the file is suspicious as 
it is from an unknown source. I can guarantee you that the program will not affect your computer in any malicious ways despite what Windows says.
When the blue window comes up on running the program, click "More Details", and then "Run Anyway".

## Commands
Type the name of any weapon, bow, shield, or armour set into the terminal to see specific details.
